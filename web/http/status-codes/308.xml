			<h1>308 Permanent Redirect</h1>
			<p>The 308 Permanent Redirect HTTP status code tells clients the request was not filled, but the resource has been moved to another location; the client must update references with the old URI and re-issue the request at the new URI to complete the operation.</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>Servers should produce <code>308 Permanent Redirect</code> when a resource or set of resources has been assigned a new URI, especially one at a different authority/origin server.</p>
			<p>308 redirects can typically be configured as a search-and-replace on the request-URI.</p>
			<p>For a period of time, servers should instead issue <code>307 Temporary Redirect</code>, so that if there is an error in the redirect, it won't cause clients to adjust their bookmarks to a URI that doesn't exist.</p>

			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p><code>308 Permanent Redirect</code> is an indication the client should adjust references to a different URI. If the client has any bookmarks, they should first be updated to the new URI.</p>
			<p>Then, the request should be re-tried at the URI.</p>
			<p>The server doesn't necessarily know anything about the target URI; the request at the redirect target might fail, but this doesn't change handling of the 308 response.</p>
