			<h1>413 Payload Too Large</h1>
			<p>The 413 Payload Too Large HTTP status code indicates an unexpected or over-long request message body.</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>Servers should produce <code>413 Payload Too Large</code> in these cases:</p>

			<h3>Method doesn't permit a message body</h3>
			<p>If the method is not one that allows a request body (such as TRACE), then send <code>413 Payload Too Large</code> along with a message explaining that no message body is allowed in the request.</p>

			<h3>Message body exceeds resource limits</h3>
			<p>If the server has resource limits, or sets resource limits on users, and the upload size exceeds these limits, send <code>413 Payload Too Large</code> along with a document describing the maximum permitted size.</p>
			<p>If the client did not send a Content-Length and the upload becomes too large to accept, close the connection after writing the response.</p>

			<h3>See also: Server is out of storage space</h3>
			<p>If the server would normally be able to accept an upload, but cannot at the moment because it must be written to a location that has insufficient free space, see <a href="507.xml">507 Insufficient Storage</a> instead.</p>

			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p>This error typically requires user intervention; the user must figure out how to reduce the upload size.</p>
			<p>If the server has a mechanism for breaking the upload into smaller parts, clients may implement this process and try that.</p>
			<p>If the error is due to calling a method that does not accept a request message body, the client must be reworked to not make that request with a message body.</p>
