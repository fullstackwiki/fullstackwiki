			<h1>HTTP Effective Request URI</h1>

			<h2>Making Requests</h2>
			<p>Two lines are used to form the effective Request URI: the request-line (the first line in the request), and the Host header.</p>
			<p>HTTP allows requests with an absolute-form URI in the request-line, however this is not supported by very many servers, and is typically only used by proxies. That is, a request in absolute form typically indicates a request to make a proxied request, instead of an origin request the server can answer authortatively.</p>
			<p>Most requests will be made with the origin-form:</p>
			<pre type="abnf"> origin-form    = absolute-path [ "?" query ]</pre>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<pre type="message/http" w:space="indent">
				GET /where?q=now HTTP/1.1
				Host: www.example.org
			</pre>
			<p>It is not possible to explicitly send the scheme being used HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 using the origin-form, however the server is usually able to detect the scheme being used.</p>

			<h2>Parsing Requests</h2>
			<h3>Parsing the headers</h3>
			<p>If a request lacks or has more than one Host header, it MUST generate a <code>400 Bad Request</code> response.</p>
			<p>The Host header is used to construct the effective Request-URI. This is described in <a href="../Request-URI.html">Effective Request URI</a>.</p>
			<!-- TODO mark this as environment-specific -->
			<aside><p>Node.js automatically ignores repeated Host headers. For HTTP compliance, it may be necessary to scan the <code>request.rawHeaders</code> data.</p></aside>
