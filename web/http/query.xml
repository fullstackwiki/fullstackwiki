			<h1>Queries in HTTP</h1>
			<p>Typically in HTTP, a client downloads resources, and processes them locally. The query resource paradigm instead allows a client to submit a query, which is processed on the server side, returning results in the response body. The resource that processes the query is called an <i>endpoint</i>. Query endpoints are typically used when the data set that must be computed is truly massive, or if the query is very complicated and too long to fit into a URI.</p>
			<p>A single HTTP endpoint may choose to implement all of the below solutions, or just one.</p>

			<h2>GET requests</h2>
			<p>For short queries that do fit in the request URI, query resources should support GET requests that allow query parameters added to the endpoint URI.</p>
			<p>For example, if the endpoint is <code>http://example.com/foo</code>, then the resource representing the query results could be <code>http://example.com/foo?q={query}</code>. The name of the parameter is arbitrary, but <code>q</code> is short and common. The parameter name can be omitted entirely: <code>http://example.com/foo?{query}</code> is also acceptable, but this is not compatible with HTML forms.</p>
			<p>A GET request to the query resource (without a provided query) must describe the syntax with a URI Template or an HTML form. The response should also include a description of the data that will be queried over, and the query syntax.</p>
			<aside><p>While GET permits a request body, the semantics are undefined, meaning intermediate nodes are allowed to discard it. Additionally, caches may have a hard time storing responses, because this is very atypical behavior.</p></aside>

			<h2>POST requests (redirect version)</h2>
			<p>This version is most friendly to Web browsers. Follow the typical POST behavior: create a new resource, then perform a <a href="status-codes/303.xml">303 (See Other) redirect</a> to that resource. A <a href="status-codes/201.xml">201 (Created)</a> or <a href="status-codes/200.xml">200 (OK)</a> response would also be acceptable (depending on if the resource was created or not), but See Other is more compatible with Web browsers without losing significant functionality.</p>
			<p>The best URI to mint is a content-addressable resource, one based on the contents of the query, so that a potential attacker would have to know the query in order to predict the URI being created. A simple hash of the query contents should suffice:</p>
			<pre w:space="indent">
				POST /query HTTP/1.1
				Content-Type: application/json

				{ "id": { "$gt": 200 } }
			</pre>
			<pre w:space="indent">
				HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
				Location: /query/01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c0
			</pre>
			<p>The resource may be deleted once it has been read by the client; or it may be cleaned out some time after as part of a normal cache clearing process.</p>
			<p>Queries may also be retained indefinitely, like more traditional POST requests that create a resource, and treated as first-class resources that can be shared amongst users. They may then be deleted by the user when no longer necessary.</p>
			<p>The server should keep a distinction between the resource that is the query, and the resource that is the query results. If the server needs to make the text of the original query available, it should be provided as a separate resource, linked to and from the query results resource.</p>
			<p>To support HTML forms, servers should also support <code>Content-Type: application/x-www-urlencoded</code> requests, accepting the same syntax seen in the query component of a GET request.</p>

			<h2>POST requests (safe version)</h2>
			<p>This form is the same as the REPORT method below, but uses POST instead. It is intended for workflows where the client or server do not support the REPORT method, but must use a similar workflow. For use in Web browsers, the redirect version (above) is preferred.</p>
			<p>For servers supporting both the redirect and safe variants, servers may use a <a href="headers/Prefer.xml">Prefer request-header</a> to specify the behavior to use.</p>

			<h2>REPORT requests</h2>
			<p><i>Main article: <a href="methods/REPORT.xml">REPORT method</a></i></p>
			<p>REPORT is an "extensible mechanism for obtaining information about a resource". When using this method, simply upload the query as the request-body.</p>
			<aside><p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-3.6">REPORT is defined in WebDAV</a>, but is acceptable for general use in HTTP.</p></aside>

			<h2>SEARCH requests</h2>
			<p>This method is similar to REPORT: you simply upload the query as the request-body. This method is specifically defined to run a query over a set of resources, but it requires a WebDAV multi-status response.</p>
			<aside><p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5323#section-2">SEARCH is defined in WebDAV</a>, but is acceptable for general use in HTTP. It requires all responses to be a WebDAV multi-status response. It is possible some clients may try calling it if the server supports it, but this is unlikely to cause harm since it is a safe method. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-search-method-00">An Internet-Draft draft-snell-search-method-00</a> proposes changing this behavior to be more generic, and introduces an Accept-Search response header.</p></aside>
