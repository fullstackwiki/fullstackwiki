# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-level Internet protocol for transferring and manipulating representations of resources, such as webpages. HTTP supports many features, including retreiving and manipulating resources, caching, content negotiation, range (subset) requests, link relationships, authentication, and more.

Use HTTP whenever you need to download files from another system on a network, or let clients manipulate the documents, settings, or devices on the network.

## Uses for HTTP

* Downloading & uploading documents
* Making changes to documents
* Changing the state of a resource
* Authenticating users making requests
* Checking if a document has changed
* Publishing link relationships between resources
