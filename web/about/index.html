			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>WebDev.docs is a repository of documentation for how to build reliable, accessible, cross-platform Web applications.</p>
			<h2>Authoring</h2>
			<p>Content is authored in bare HTML files annotated with RDFa. Data about the content is embedded using RDFa, extracted from the documents, and used to create lists of content elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Nits</h2>
<p>Often while looking in retrospect, we wouldn't have designed standards the way they were. We should learn from these mistakes and point out the right way to do it, so they don't get repeated. These should be pointed out as soon as they're introduced, if possible. Articles should have a section called "Nits" that describes the problems, and the right way to go about them.</p>
<p>These problems might include things such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Misspellings</li>
	<li>Inconstistencies between standards</li>
	<li>Willful violations of standards</li>
	<li>Historical reasons for bad behavior</li>
</ul>
