			<h1>Configuration File Formats</h1>
			<p>Software often needs to store various settings or configurations to adapt to the user's needs.</p>

			<h2>TOML</h2>
			<p>TOML is a configuration file format designed to be highly user-editable and -readable.</p>

			<h2>JSON</h2>
			<p>JSON works well when the configuration information is simply being serialized from memory, and is not typically used directly. It's plain text format means it is easily debugged, and can be hand-edited if necessary. However, it lacks comments, multi-line strings, and other features that make it good for user-maintained files.</p>
