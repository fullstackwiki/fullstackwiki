			<h1>308 Permanent Redirect</h1>
			<p>The 308 Permanent Redirect HTTP status code tells clients the request was not filled, but the resource has been moved to another location; the client must update references with the old URI and re-issue the request at the new URI to complete the operation.</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>Servers should produce <code>308 Permanent Redirect</code> when a resource or set of resources has been assigned a new URI, especially one at a different authority/origin server.</p>
			<p>308 redirects can typically be configured as a search-and-replace on the request-URI.</p>
			<p>For a period of time, servers should instead issue <code>307 Temporary Redirect</code>, so that if there is an error in the redirect, it won't cause clients to adjust their bookmarks to a URI that doesn't exist.</p>

			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p><code>308 Permanent Redirect</code> is an indication the client should adjust references to a different URI. If the client has any bookmarks, they should first be updated to the new URI.</p>
			<p>Then, the request should be re-tried at the URI.</p>
			<p>The server doesn't necessarily know anything about the target URI; the request at the redirect target might fail, but this doesn't change handling of the 308 response.</p>

			<h2>Implementations</h2>

			<h3>cURL</h3>
			<p>cURL correctly supports 308 redirects by following generic 300 semantics, if the response includes a Location header. It does not provide an explicit mechanism to rewrite or update URL references. A test for this status code was added in <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f1092b387e1fa82db35c75a217bda91e94f0ee6e">cURL 7.24.0</a>.</p>

			<h3>Nginx</h3>
			<p>Nginx will send 308 Permanent Redirect when you use a rewrite rule with the <code>permanent</code> flag:</p>
			<pre w:space="indent">
				# Redirect www.example.com to example.com
				server {
					listen 80;
					server_name www.example.com;
				
					location / {
						rewrite  ^(/.*)  https://example.com$1  permanent;
					}
				}
			</pre>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<h3>2015-04: <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7538.html">RFC 7538</a></h3>
			<p>This status code largely replaces the <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> status code, which has a more ambiguous definition, and is inconsistently implemented by Web browsers. See the specification text for more information.</p>

			<h3>2022-06: <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#status.308">RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics</a>.</h3>
			<p>The 308 status code is incorporated into HTTP Semantics.</p>
